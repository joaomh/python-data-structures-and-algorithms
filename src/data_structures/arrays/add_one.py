Problem Statement
You are given a non-negative number in the form of list elements. 
For example, the number 123 would be provided as arr = [1, 2, 3]. 
Add one to the number and return the output in the form of a new list.

Example 1:

input = [1, 2, 3]
output = [1, 2, 4]
Example 2:

input = [9, 9, 9]
output = [1, 0, 0, 0]
Challenge:

One way to solve this problem is to 
convert the input array into a number and then add one to it.
 For example, if we have input = [1, 2, 3], 
 you could solve this problem by creating the number 123 and 
 then separating the digits of the output number 124.

But can you solve it in some other way?
